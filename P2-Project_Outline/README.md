## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Whether you live in an apartment, a condo, a house, or an RV, you will want to complete projects or maintain your living space, which will require equipment. Some people want to buy every tool or piece of equipment they will need to complete any project, but many people cannot afford to buy specialized equipment, don't have space to store all the equipment they could ever use, or simply need the tool right now and don't want to waste time visiting one or more hardware stores to find the tool. This application allows neighbors to save money, save space, save time, and build community by making it easy for them to lend, borrow, and track tools and other equipment on demand. This application will facilitate borrowing by allowing users to solicit requests anonymously, arrange a meeting location, exchange equipment, and track the equipment until it has been returned to the lender.
